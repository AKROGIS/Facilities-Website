2019-09-10 Presentation Outline
===============================

* A tool for locating the maintained infrastructure in Alaska
    - focus on locations and photos
    - location includes extent for roads, trails, parkinglots, etc
    - meant to be very fast and simple (it is **not** a swiss army knife)

* History and old features
    - Prototype app for buildings has been around since early 2015
    - little has changed there
    - find buildings in an area by panning/zooming around the map
        (zoom into Gates)
    - The marker symbol and hover text will give some immediate information.
        - building and Location record #
    - Get selected FMSS/GIS information by clicking on an item
        - click on bottom right building, and describe 
    - if an item has photos, you can browse the thumbnails,
        - or click on the photo to get the full size watermarked image.
        - watermarks are semi-dynamic
    - You can also find a feature by searching by the FMSS ID
        -  search on **232129**
        - note:
        - search filters as you type,
        - matches any part of the ID,
        - and also describes type of feture
    - Note Locations do not always match the imagery exactly
        - it may be the accuracy of the GPS device used,
        - or inaccuracy in the imagery
        - or it may be an error

* Map Navigation
    - Zoom to Home
    - describe buttons
    - other zoom options: zoom with wheel, shift drag rectangle, or click on cluster
    - Example: zoom into Savage bridge

* Additional feature beyond buildings
    - We have now added Roads, Parking Lots, Bridges, Trails, and Trail side Features
    - We plan to add IM, Maintained Landscapes, Utilities and parents for all the above
      - When location is obvious.
    - Ideally we would have locations for all FMSS locations/Assets
    - We are still working on symbology (the variability of imagery makes this tricky)
        - labels only on FMSS Roads and trails
        - markers only at ends of roads/trails
        - pan down park road
    - Click on markers for paved road
        - pretty much the same as buildings, big differnce is Size
        - Quantity FMSS <> GIS
        - We do not have a lot of pictures for road, trails, bridges yet.
    - Click on markers for bridge
        - we also have bridges
        - all items have a link to the parent
    - Click on Parking lot
        - compare GIS size to FMSS size
        - GIS has East/West, but FMSS has a single record
        - we would be happy to improve our exents based on your input.

* Big add is trail side features
    - click around Savage trail head (picnic tables, benches, sign)
        - expand sign photo, asset info
        - click on parent link
    - currently only have DENA, working on WRST, KLGO

* Close out
    - Show and Discuss TO DO list
    - Solicit questions and missing requirements
    - URL is live give it a try and provide your feedback
    - Request ideas for outreach
